The 7 steps to solving programming problems

1: Work Example by hand;
    -> make sure you understand the problem;
        - need domain knowledge: if the problem is a math or physics problem,
          make sure you understand the concept before trying to attack it;
    -> try to work a smaller version of the problem by hand;
        - if the problem is moving pictures in a picture, think about it first
          as moving only, say, 4 pixels;
2: Write down what you did;
    -> Write down the exact steps of what was done;
    -> just that instance: the exact steps to solve this little probelm, not
       something more general;
    -> Tricky: do without thinking;
       - be consious of the things we do without thinking about them: the computer
         does not have this ability;
3: Find patterns;
    -> Algorithm for any instance;
    -> Find parterns:
       - Repitition, conditions, values: The things we do over and over;
       - The point where things loop back;
    -> Difficulties?;
       - Try step 1 + 2 again;
       - Different inputs;
4: Check by Hand:
    -> Incorrect pattern?;
       - Find now: Check with different inputs;
5: Translate to Code:
    -> Programming language;
6: Run test cases on code:
    -> Execute program;
    -> Check answer: Must know the right answer before time;
7: Debug Failed Test Cases;
    -> Test failed? Debug;
       - use scientific method;
       - understand the problem and fix;
    -> Algorithmic problem?: return to step 3;
    -> Implementation problem?: return to step 5;
